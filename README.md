# Traffic-Analysis

This project concerns the analysis of factors that contributed to accidents involving serious fatalities (accidents in which there is more than one fatality) for the year 2015, and employs a machine learning model to predict whether serious fatalities are likely to occur based on these factors.  

Included is the following file:

Traffic_Analysis_Final_Report.ipynb--The final report and code with output in Jupyter Notebook form

Additionally included are the following supporting files:

1.  Initial Capstone Proposals.pdf--Inital ideas for this project and other projects
